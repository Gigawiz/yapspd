1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Introductional Rant</h2>
<br>
If you don't know what programming a machine down to the metal is
all about, go away! no really, this document is not for you! if you
are seeking for advice on using existing solutions, such as SDKs or
libraries, you will find little to none information that is of any
use for you and you might only become frustrated by figuring out how
little you know. If you however aren't afraid of numbers and want
to dare jumping into the snake-pit of semi-accurate information based
on guesswork done by a bunch of freaks - feel invited. this was made
to give you what you need in the most compressed and visually pleasing
form possible. <em>Stuff that matters.</em>

1.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Things that are in this document</h3>
<br>
just about everything explicitly and specifically related to the PSP
hard- and software internals and its programming. everything inside
the box is subject to be documented, may it be relevant for actual
programming or not. its ment as a reference for everyone who wants
to know in all possible detail what makes this thing tick.<br><br>
one more thing: please notice that this is a technical documentation
which is presented for pure educational purposes and higher learning,
and not a moral lesson. i have decided against leaving out any information
since i believe that information by itself should not be crippled
in any way. if you choose to abuse this information for any kind of
illegal activities (<b>PLEASE DON'T!</b>) so be it, but don't bother
me with it.

1.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Things that are <em>not</em> in this document</h3>
<br>
several things were decided to not being put into this document because
they didn't fit into the 'technical documentation' type of concept.
They may be documented seperatly some time but not now and not here.
These things are:
<ul>
<li> Tips on Emulating the PSP on another Host system (this kind of information
is only useful for a very limited number of people, and additionally
might be highly confusing and/or misleading for those who are writing
actual PSP programs)
</li>
<li> Instructions on using any tools that let you upload and execute code
on the PSP, or any other development related tools <b>except</b>
anything related to setting up and using gcc as a cross-compiler targeted
to the PSP.
</li>
<li> anything related to gaming, cheat-codes and the like. (this is a tech-doc
not a gaming FAQ!)
</li>
<li> detailed and/or complete sourcecode, except when a formal explanation
would just over-complicate things. (this is a documentation, not a
code library)
</li>
<li> anything related to playing/booting/copying pirated games (as you
may have noticed, <b>we do not support piracy!</b>)
</li>
</ul>
some of these may be arguable, so if you think they should be here
- probably along the lines of the appendix - don't hesitate to write
the chapter in question and send it to me. i might include it if you
write it, but other than that i wont care (there is still enough other
stuff to complete).

<a name="sec1.3">
1.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Conventions</h3>
<br><ul>
<li> we count bits starting from 0, the most significant bit of a byte
is bit 7. when visualising a byte the most significant bit comes first
(left), and the least significant bit comes last (right).
</li>
<li> when dealing with 16- or 32 byte values all figures are in big endian
byte order. this means that the most significant byte comes first
(left), and the least significant byte comes last (right). notice
that this is <b>not</b> the way values are actually handled by the
allegrex cpu (since it is little endian).
</li>
<li> if known (from patents or other freely available sources) we use the
same terminology as Sony does, in particular we try to use the same
names and abbreviations for hardware registers, signals and the like
as a weak attempt of providing consistency with other existing documentation.
</li>
<li> absolute memory addresses are shown as used in real world PSP Programs.
For this matter we dont use physical adresses to avoid confusion for
the majority of our readers.
</li>
<li> code snippets are in either real or pseudo C language. any logical
or arithmetic expressions outside code snippets are loosely simelar
to C notation according to the following table:
<table><tr><td nowrap align="center">
<table>
<tr>
<td nowrap><b>Description</b></td>
<td nowrap align="center"><b>Symbol</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap>logical or bitwhise AND</td>
<td nowrap align="center"><tt>&amp;</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap>logical or bitwhise OR</td>
<td nowrap align="center"><tt>|</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap>logical or bitwhise exclusive OR</td>
<td nowrap align="center"><tt>^</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap>logical or bitwhise NOT (inverse)</td>
<td nowrap align="center"><tt>!</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap>equality or assignment</td>
<td nowrap align="center"><tt>=</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap>addition</td>
<td nowrap align="center"><tt>+</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap>substraction</td>
<td nowrap align="center"><tt>-</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap>multiplication</td>
<td nowrap align="center"><tt>*</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap>division</td>
<td nowrap align="center"><tt>/</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>
</td></tr></table>
<br><br>
please notice that -outside code- we do not make a difference between
logical and bitwhise operations. if in doubt the operation is bitwhise,
it should however be clearly visible from the context.
