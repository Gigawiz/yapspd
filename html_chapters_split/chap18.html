18.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Serial Communications</h3>
<br>
The PSP communicates with the microcontroller inside the remote control
using RS232 serial communication (although the voltages are different
of course, 0V and +2.5V) using 8N1 framing at 4800bps. The protocol
consists of command packages which can be send by either the PSP or
the remote control. A package is exchanged as follows:<br><br><tt></tt>

<tt></tt>
<table>
<tr>
<td nowrap><b>Sender</b></td>
<td nowrap align="center"><b>Reciever</b></td>
<td nowrap><b>description</b></td>

<td nowrap align="center">&nbsp;</td>
<td nowrap>Request to transmit </td>

<td nowrap>Packet starts </td>

<tr>
<td nowrap>cmd </td>
<td nowrap align="center">&nbsp;</td>
<td nowrap>Command code + phase </td>

<tr>
<td nowrap>params</td>
<td nowrap align="center">&nbsp;</td>
<td nowrap>Zero or more bytes of parameter data </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap>checksum</td>
<td nowrap align="center">&nbsp;</td>
<td nowrap>XOR of the cmd and params bytes </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap>0xFE</td>
<td nowrap align="center">&nbsp;</td>
<td nowrap>Packet ends </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap>&nbsp;</td>
<td nowrap align="center">0xFA/0xFB</td>
<td nowrap>Packet received correctly</td>
</tr>
</table>
</td></tr></table>
<tt></tt>&nbsp;<br><tt></tt>&nbsp;<br>
If the packet is not received correctly, or the receiver is too busy
to allow the packet to be transmitted, the corresponding 0xFA/0xFB/0xF8
is not sent, in which case the sender should wait a while (60 ms)
and then try again from the 0xF0. If no answer is received in a long
time (&gt; 1s), a BREAK can be sent to reset the communication channel,
after which the state should be the same as if the remote control
had been disconnected and reconnected again. 
The least significant bit of the cmd byte is the phase indicator,
which is used to differentiate a new command from the retransmission
of an old one. The first packet sent from a particular device has
phase 0 (LSB = 0), and is acknowledged with 0xFA. Then the phase is
inverted each time a new packets is sent. Packets with phase 1 are
acknowledged with 0xFB. Phase is not shared, so when the PSP sends
a packet it does not affect the phase of the remote control, and vice
versa. 
Note that there seems to be no particular way to know how many parameter
bytes are contained in the message, as the parameter bytes or the
checksum could contain an 0xFE as well. It is therefore necessary
to know how many parameter bytes each command takes. 
The command sent by the remote control to inform the PSP of what buttons
are pressed is 0x84. It takes two parameter bytes, which if interpreted
as a 16-bit integer (little endian) forms a bitfield like so:<br><br><tt></tt>

</td></tr></table>

Buttons that are pressed have their corresponding bits set to 1. Buttons
that are not pressed or do not exist have their corresponding bits
set to 0.<br><br>
The 0x80 command has some parameter bytes, and I'm guessing these
are used to identify the type of device connected. There could also
be any number (well, a bit over 100 at least) of commands to request
specific kinds of services from the PSP.
