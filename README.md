Yet another Playstation Portable Documentation

for your convinience this document is available for offline-viewing in the following formats:

pdf (primary document, recommended for printing)
html (one large file, without any site-specific formatting)
html (splitted into chapters like the online version, without any site-specific formatting)
txt (for terminal users and easy grep-ing)

and last not least the online version is <a href="https://gigawiz.github.io/yapspd/html_chapters_split/"> Here </a>.

for the curious there is now a changelog and also a list of things that are still missing that you can check if you want to help to make this thing more complete.
